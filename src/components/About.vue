      Hi, I'm
      <span class="font-semibold text-indigo-400">John Licar</span> — a web developer with a passion
      for building practical, real-world solutions. My journey started back in college when a
      <strong>Local Government Unit (LGU)</strong> hired our team to develop an information system
      for their office. After graduation, they brought me on board permanently — and since then,
      I've developed multiple systems that became integral to their daily operations. Outside of
      that, I also take on <strong>freelance projects</strong>, helping businesses bring their ideas
      to life through clean, functional, and efficient code.
